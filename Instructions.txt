How you will be evaluated
Our goal is to see how you start to work and think through a problem like this, and expect to see
something at the &quot;prototype stage.&quot; What we want to see is how you would develop an initial prototype
and document it for other highly technical, data scientist/engineer colleagues. What design choices did
(or would) you make, and why?
Again, the scraper described here would take significantly more than 3 hours to “fully” complete. We do
not expect a fully complete package, perfect code / perfectly documented code, or a complete database
of all this scraped information.

Design:

Prototype Application is designed to support Synchronus and Asynchronus processing.

API Gateway for real time scraping.
Bulk processing for batch jobs
Kafka Streaming support to avoid realtime hit to the website

What you need?
